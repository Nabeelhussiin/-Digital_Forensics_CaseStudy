Overview:   
This project is a digital forensics case study focused on identifying suspicious image files, specifically pictures containing fish, within a dataset. The investigation involved examining file metadata and contents, as well as using provided cryptographic hashes to verify file integrity. The work also included locating other suspicious or anomalous files that could indicate tampering or misuse.


Case description:
The case simulates a forensic investigation into a collection of files where some images containing fish are considered suspicious and potentially linked to malicious or hidden activity. The dataset includes various file types, and the task is to locate relevant images, verify their integrity, and highlight any files that stand out as unusual. All work is carried out in an academic context for training and learning purposes, not as part of a real criminal investigation

Methodology:
The investigation followed a standard digital forensics workflow: identification, preservation, examination, analysis, and reporting. Tools and techniques were used to browse and filter images, inspect metadata, compute and compare hashes, and review directory contents for anomalies. Each action taken, along with observations and decisions, was recorded in the logbook to maintain a clear chain of documentation.

Findings and conclusions:
The case study resulted in the identification of image files containing fish that matched the criteria for suspicious content, along with other files that appeared unusual based on their names, locations, or properties. Hash comparisons confirmed the integrity of relevant files where hashes matched, and highlighted any discrepancies where they did not. The research report summarises these findings, explains the reasoning behind them, and discusses any limitations of the analysis.


How to read the logbook:
The logbook is organised chronologically, showing timestamps, commands or tools used, files examined, and observations made at each stage. Readers can follow the investigation step by step to understand how evidence was located, how hashes were verified, and how conclusions were reached.
